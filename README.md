# ERIC - Emergency Readiness In a Case

## ***You never know when disaster might strike***

> [Ready.gov](ready.gov) defines more than 25 types of disasters and emergencies, including:
> - earthquakes
> - hurricanes
> - space weather
> - volcanoes

In the event of a disaster or emergency, it is of utmost importance to **Have A Plan.**

I want to help you to have a plan.

### What is ERIC?
- ERIC stands for "Emergency Readiness In a Case" and it ~~is~~ will be ~~exactly~~ close to what it sounds like.
- ERIC is fundamentally a RaspberryPi in a box.
- There have been several projects like this over the years, but I wanted to create something specifically based on one concept: **emergency and disaster preparedness**
 
### Is ERIC for sale?
- No! This is a DIY project.
- All of the parts in this project are commonlyy available. You can (and should!) feel free to modify the ERIC template to fit your specific needs.
- I shall be documenting the progress of this project every step of the way.

### Where is ERIC?
- ERIC began development on 2023-10-29.
- This is a brand-new project, and I shall be updating it as I have time to work on it.
- My goal is to have a functional prototype sometime in mid-to-late-November, 2023.

## Goals
1. Finish this project.
2. Help others to try and remain safe during an emergency or disaster.
